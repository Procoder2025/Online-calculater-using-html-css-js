ðŸ”¢ Online Calculator â€“ Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

I developed an interactive online calculator that provides a seamless user experience for performing basic arithmetic operations. This project showcases my front-end development skills and focuses on:

âœ… Clean & responsive UI for smooth user experience
âœ… Efficient JavaScript logic for accurate calculations
âœ… Stylish design using CSS for an engaging look
âœ… Fast performance & lightweight structure

This project helped me improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation.

Excited to work on more innovative web applications! ðŸš€
